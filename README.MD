Proposal:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to try and solve or at least mitigate crime in the US, we must first understand how it starts by asking the initial questions and setting the groundwork for further analyzation and exploration. 
    
     What influences crime? Is there a correlation between voting trends and crime rates? What other factors may be making an impact on crime? Does this translate to an individual state? 

There are many underlying issues when it comes to this problem, however, we feel starting with these questions is the best route for initial inquiry. 

Our initial assumption was that we would notice a relationship between crime rates and voting trends by party affiliation. We supposed that violent crime rates would be more prominent in democratic leaning states or blue states as we referred to them in our analysis; we also hypothesized that property crime rates would be higher in republican leaning states or red states. We also rationalized that there would be a correlation between hate crimes and violent crimes. Additionally, we theorized unemployment rates would have an effect on crime rates, specifically violent crime rates. We were in agreement that the data we found would lead us to ask other helpful questions and provide a roadmap for future study.
Using the concept of data analytics we can extract useful information from unstructured data. Instead of focusing on causes of crime occurrence we are focusing mainly on potential crime factors, specifically the most current data available, data from the year 2018.For this analysis we used data visualization tools- Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly- to aid us in our exploration and data manipulation

We will mainly be utilizing data from https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/
and will follow their definition of a violent crime and property crime.
